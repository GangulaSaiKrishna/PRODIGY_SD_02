# Guessing Game (Tkinter App)

A simple number guessing game built with **Python** and **Tkinter**.  
The program randomly generates a number between **1 and 100**, and the player tries to guess it.  
After each guess, the game provides feedback whether the guess is **too high**, **too low**, or **correct**.  
It also tracks the number of attempts and allows restarting the game anytime.
